# Walmart Sales Analysis SQL Project
This project involves analyzing sales data from Walmart to derive insights that can help improve business decision-making processes. The analysis was conducted using SQL queries to answer various business questions related to sales transactions, product performance, customer behavior, and overall profitability.

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were to:

Analyze sales data to understand business performance across different branches, cities, and product lines.
Derive actionable insights by querying specific aspects of the sales transactions.
Identify trends and patterns in customer behavior and product sales.
Business Questions Addressed

# The SQL queries in this project were designed to answer the following business questions:

1. Retrieve all columns for sales made in a specific branch (e.g., Branch 'A').

This query helps in focusing on sales data specific to a particular branch for detailed analysis.

2.  Find the total sales for each product line.

This query provides insights into the performance of different product lines, helping to identify top-performing categories.

3. List all sales transactions where the payment method was 'Cash'.

Understanding the preferred payment methods can help tailor marketing and customer service strategies.

4. Calculate the total gross income generated in each city.

This query helps in identifying which cities are generating the most revenue and can be used to make strategic decisions about resource allocation.

5. Find the average rating given by customers in each branch.

Customer satisfaction is key to business success, and this query helps assess the average customer experience at each branch.
Determine the total quantity of each product line sold.

Analyzing product line sales volume helps in understanding customer preferences and inventory management.

6. List the top 5 products by unit price.

Identifying high-value products can inform pricing strategies and promotional efforts.

7. Find sales transactions with a gross income greater than 30.

This query focuses on identifying high-profit transactions for profitability analysis.

8. Retrieve sales transactions that occurred on weekends.

Analyzing weekend sales helps in understanding customer shopping patterns and planning for peak times.

9. Calculate the total sales and gross income for each month.

Monthly analysis provides insights into sales trends and seasonality, aiding in forecasting and planning.

9. Find the number of sales transactions that occurred after 6 PM.

This query helps analyze evening shopping patterns, which can be useful for staffing and marketing.

10. List the sales transactions that have a higher total than the average total of all transactions.

Understanding which transactions are above average in total helps in identifying significant sales activities.

11. Calculate the cumulative gross income for each branch by date.

Tracking cumulative gross income provides a running total of profitability by branch, useful for performance tracking.
12. Find the total COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) for each customer type in each city.

Analyzing the cost of goods sold helps in understanding the profitability of different customer segments in various locations.
# Conclusion
The insights derived from these queries can help Walmart optimize its sales strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and increase overall profitability. This project demonstrates the power of SQL in extracting valuable information from large datasets and making data-driven decisions.
